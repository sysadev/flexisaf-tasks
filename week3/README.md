# Week 3 Task

## Description
This assignment demonstrates how to define a custom Annotation Type in Java.
It defines an annotation called `@EnhancementRequest` with specific elements (`id`, `synopsis`) and default values for others (`engineer`, `date`).

## Files
- `EnhancementRequest.java`: The definition of the custom annotation.
- `AnnotationDemo.java`: A simple class that applies the annotation to verify it works.

## How to Run
1. Open your terminal in this folder.
2. Compile both files:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the demo:
   ```
   java AnnotationDemo
   ```

## Expected Output
```
EnhancementRequest annotation defined and applied successfully.
```
