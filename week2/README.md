# Week 2 Task

## Description
This is a simple Java program that demonstrates how to use the `Iterator` interface. It creates a list of programming languages and removes a specific element (Bug) while looping through the list.

Using an Iterator is important because it allows you to safely remove items from a collection while you are still looking through it, which prevents errors that often happen with standard loops.

## Files
- `IteratorLoop.java`: The main Java source code file.

## How to Run
1. Save the code as `IteratorLoop.java`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the code using the command: `javac IteratorLoop.java`
4. Run the program using the command: `java IteratorLoop`

## Expected Output
```
[Java, Python, C++]
```
