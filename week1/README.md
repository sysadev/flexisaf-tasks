# Week 1 Task

## Description
This program demonstrates how to write a generic method in Java. The method counts the number of elements in a collection that have a specific property.

It uses Java Generics to handle different types of data (like Integers and Strings) using a single method. The program includes examples for counting:
- Odd numbers
- Prime numbers
- Palindromes (words that read the same backwards and forwards)

## Files
- `GenericCounter.java`: The main Java source code file.

## How to Run
1. Save the code as `GenericCounter.java`
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the code using: `javac GenericCounter.java`
4. Run the program using: `java GenericCounter`

## Expected Output
```
Odd numbers: 4
Primes: 4
Palindromes: 2
```
